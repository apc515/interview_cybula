The Challenge
=============

This folder contains a simple Maven project with tests that rely on JUnit and Guava.

1. Clone this git repository.
2. Fix the dependencies and implement the missing functionality in Implementation.java
3. Commit the changes back to the repository.
4. Extend the getNumbers() method to ignore comment lines in the file (comment line start with #). Remember to implement the test stub.
5. Add any additional test that you think are necessary.
6. Commit the changes back to the repository.
